### statistical methods in computational biology

The enormously fast pace of technological development in the biological sciences
routinely generates new classes of data that pose novel issues for statistical
inference. I am interested in the development and proper application of robust
methods for analyzing data generated from emerging biotechnologies, especially
those techniques which make minimalistic distributional assumptions. In
particular, my work in this area includes the development of methods for
analyzing and exploring data from [DNA
Methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_representation_bisulfite_sequencing)
and [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) assays, as well as the
application of data-adaptive statistical target parameters (for avoiding the
pitfalls of multiple testing) and targeted minimum loss-based estimation.

### causal inference and nonparametric statistics

Statistical (machine) learning provides an ever-growing diversity of flexible
techniques for performing robust statistical estimation. Such techniques can be
leveraged to build tools for estimating causal parameters (_e.g._, the effects
of interventions based on counterfactuals), an area of work which comprises both
an incredible scientific opportunity and challenge for modern statistical
practice. In this area, my interests include the theory and application of
targeted minimum loss-based estimation, ensemble (machine) learning methods for
robust estimation (_e.g._, [Super
Learner](http://biostats.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&context=ucbbiostat)),
nonparametric statistics, and data-adaptive estimation for inference under model
misspecification.
