<a name="chris-kennedy"></a>__Chris J. Kennedy__<br/>
_Biography:_ Chris is a biostatistics Ph.D. student with interests in RCTs,
machine learning, and targeted causal inference applied to precision medicine,
cancer, and public health. He works with Alan on the [varimpact R
package](http://github.com/ck37/varimpact) and health prediction for trauma
patients (e.g. traumatic brain injury). He also co-maintains the [SuperLearner R
package](http://github.com/ecpolley/SuperLearner), employs high performance
computing (Savio cluster, Amazon EC2, XSEDE), and is affiliated with
[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consultation/chris-kennedy), Berkeley Institute
for Data Science, and the Integrative Cancer Research Group.<br/>

<a name="jonathan-levy"></a>__Jonathan Levy__<br/>
_Biography:_ Jonathan is a musician returning to his mathematical roots,
pursuing a renaissance-view of marrying the endeavors of humanity in the face
of practical specialization. His interests within biostatistics revolve around
being an advocate for scientists who have critical questions and for those who
need a voice from someone trained in the field of statistics, who will look at
the science and literature as well as issues not related to science, to shed
light on health issues, rather than simply taking refuge in the most highly
promoted establishment views.<br/>

<a name="ivana-malenica"></a>__Ivana Malenica__<br/>
_Biography:_ Ivana is a second-year graduate student in the Division of
Biostatistics at UC Berkeley. Broadly, her research interests span causal
inference, high-dimensional data, machine learning, and semiparametric
theory.<br/>

<a name="sara-moore"></a>__Sara Moore__<br/>
_Biography:_ Sara is a Biostatistics Ph.D. candidate in her final year of study
at UC Berkeley. She received her B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology from
Duke University and subsequently worked as a researcher in brain imaging labs
at Duke and Emory Universities. Her current research focuses on machine
learning methodology for the prediction of adverse health-related outcomes in
trauma care patients, prediction of mass trauma events using social media data,
data visualization, and statistical software package development. She also
currently works as a consultant at Genentech in South San Francisco.<br/>
