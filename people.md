### Graduate Students

__Wilson (Weixin) Cai__<br/>
_Biography:_ Wilson is a second-year graduate student in the Division of
Biostatistics at UC Berkeley and is jointly advised by Profs. Alan Hubbard and
Mark van der Laan. His research interests lie in statistical machine learning
and causal inference. Prior to Berkeley, he obtained a Bachelor's (B.Sc.)
degree in Statistics from the Univeristy of Hong Kong.<br/>
_GitHub:_ [wilsoncai1992](https://github.com/wilsoncai1992)<br/>

__Jeremy Coyle__<br/>
_Biography:_ Jeremy Coyle is a Ph.D. candidate of Biostatistics at UC Berkeley.
His research interests include cross-validation, resampling estimators, and
optimal treatment parameters. Jeremy has applied machine learning methods to a
variety of applications, including stove use monitoring, treatment assignment
for victims of traumatic injury, and the translation of raw sensor data into
meaningful estimates.<br/>

__Inna Gerlovina__<br/>
_Biography:_ Inna is a long time resident of Berkeley, CA, and a native of
St-Petersburg, Russia, where she studied at the Conservatory of Music before
turning to Statistics. She work on small sample inference and higher-order
approximations (Edgeworth expansions, bootstrap).<br/>

__Nima Hejazi__<br/>
_Biography:_ Nima is a graduate student in the Division of Biostatistics at UC
Berkeley, where he works jointly with Profs. Alan Hubbard and Mark van der
Laan. His research combines aspects of causal inference, statistical machine
learning, and nonparametric statistics, with a focus on the development of
robust methods for addressing inference problems arising in precision medicine,
computational biology, and clinical trials.<br/>

__Chris J. Kennedy__<br/>
_Biography:_ Chris is a third-year Ph.D. student with a focus on RCTs, targeted
machine learning, and casual inference applied to precision medicine,
particularly trauma. He works with Alan on the `varImpact` R package, health
prediction for trauma patients (e.g. traumatic brain injury), and analysis of
biometric waveform data (blood pressure, ECG, etc.). He also co-maintains the
`SuperLearner` R package and focuses on high performance computing (Savio,
Amazon EC2) for targeted learning.<br/>

__Jonathan Levy__<br/>
_Biography:_ Jonathan is a musician returning to his mathematical roots,
pursuing a renaissance-view of marrying the endeavors of humanity in the face
of practical specialization. His interests within biostatistics revolve around
being an advocate for scientists who have critical questions and for those who
need a voice from someone trained in the field of statistics, who will look at
the science and literature as well as issues not related to science, to shed
light on health issues, rather than simply taking refuge in the most highly
promoted establishment views.<br/>

__Ivana Malenica__<br/>
_Biography:_ Ivana is a second-year graduate student in the Division of
Biostatistics at UC Berkeley. Broadly, her research interests span causal
inference, high-dimensional data, machine learning, and semiparametric
theory.<br/>

__Sara Moore__<br/>
_Biography:_ Sara is a Biostatistics Ph.D. candidate in her final year of study
at UC Berkeley. She received her B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology from
Duke University and subsequently worked as a researcher in brain imaging labs
at Duke and Emory Universities. Her current research focuses on machine
learning methodology for the prediction of adverse health-related outcomes in
trauma care patients, prediction of mass trauma events using social media data,
data visualization, and statistical software package development. She also
currently works as a consultant at Genentech in South San Francisco.<br/>

__Andre Kurepa Waschka__<br/>
_Biography:_ Andre is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at UC Berkeley.
He finished his M.A. in Biostatistics under Dr. Hubbard in 2016. He graduated
from  North Carolina State University with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, B.S.
in Economics, and a minor in Statistics.<br/>

### Collaborators

__Prof. Romain Pirracchio__<br/>
_Biography:_ Prof. Pirracchio is a French M.D., Ph.D., hailing from Paris. He
obtained his M.D. in 2003, with a specialization in Anesthesiology and Critical
Care Medicine. In 2008, he obtained a Master's degree in Medical Research
Methodology and Biostatistics. He completed his doctoral studies in the
Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (DBIM, unité INSERM U-1153)
at Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris, France in 2012 under the guidance of Prof.
Sylvie Chevret. In 2012-2013, He spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow in
Biostatistics in the School of Public Health at the University of California,
Berkeley, where he worked under the supervision of Prof. Mark J. van der Laan
and Prof. Maya L. Petersen. Back in Paris, he was the director of the surgical
and trauma ICU at European Hospital Geroges Pompidou (2013-2015) and a
researcher in Biostatistics at the INSERM U-1153 unit. In January 2015, Dr.
Pirracchio joined the Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative care at the
San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center (UCSF) as Associate Professor.
Since September 2016, he has been at the European Hospital Geroges Pompidou in
Paris, serving as Full Professor and Vice Chair for ICUs. He is also Adjunct
Associate Professor at UCSF and affiliate to the Division of Biostatistics at
UC Berkeley.<br/>
